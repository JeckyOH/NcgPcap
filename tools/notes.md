### Notes ###

1. These tools will help you build the python scripts and transmulate them into binary form(exe).

2. PyQt4 has already been embeded into the `Python27_pyqt.rar`.

3. Py2exe has already been embeded into the `Python27_pyqt.rar`.

4. What you need to do is just unpack `Python27_pyqt.rar`, nothing no more.(Na, if you want to execute `python` command in cmd, of course you should add bin directory into env_via: PATH.)
